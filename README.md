## Bring your assets on a new level

Nftismus is an all-encompassing concept that operates through the NFM token and the AFT Dao token on the Polygon-Network. Unlike any other NFT projects, we provide a revolutionary approach that paves a completely new path for NFTs. Our primary objective is to create a platform that enables NFTs to be listed, insured, and traded on exchanges.

The valuation of NFTs is a crucial factor that determines their worth. Our platform ensures that the valuation of an NFT results in a securitizable and salable value, similar to company shares. Additionally, every asset linked to insurance makes it fail-safe and value-secured, adding an extra layer of protection to the asset. Moreover, this insurance asset is tradable, allowing users to engage in secure and profitable transactions.

We believe that the networking of assets, crypto, and securities is a highly innovative approach that will revolutionize the future of value networking. Our platform aims to create an ecosystem that seamlessly integrates real and digital values, fostering an environment where users can exchange their values with ease.

This repository is divided into 7 directories, each containing a key function within the ecosystem.

+ The NFM Ecosystem contains all smart contracts that are responsible only for the NFM Token.

+ The AFT Ecosystem contains all contracts that manage and organize our internal DAO. Some parts of it are still in development.

+ The NFT Ecosystem is a separate platform that will provide users with a personalized marketplace for NFTs with new use-cases that are not yet available on the market.

+ The AIX Project is an extension of the NFT Ecosystem that will enable anchoring NFTs in the real economy, thus protecting them from market fluctuations.

+ The NextScale Project aims to offer an investment opportunity that is based on real values.
